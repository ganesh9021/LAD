            Language learning becomes meaningful when it is connected with the
            immediate environment of the learners. Since language development
            refers to the skills used in expressing and communicating ideas, it
            involves aspects of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

            Listening is one of the most important skills for second-language
            learners. Also, it is one of the most challenging skills. Listening
            at this stage is crucial so that children are able to listen
            carefully to views put forward, reflect on them, and accordingly
            respond.

            In order to provide balanced listening instruction to the students,
            one needs to focus on the process of listening rather than just the
            product, and one needs to offer them opportunities for independent
            practice and explicit instruction, extensive and focused listening,
            challenges, and motivating experiences of success. Encourage the
            children to do the following:
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li className="subheading">Predict and listen</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ask the students to work in small groups to make predictions
                about the content and keywords. They will then listen to the
                text (audio or video) to check their predictions and note down
                additional information.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li className="subheading">Discuss and listen</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                These groups will now discuss what they hear and the things that
                they do not understand. After the second round of listening, the
                class needs to work together to outline the key contents of the
                listening text with the help of the teacher.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li className="subheading">Listen and reflect</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The students will listen to the text again and note down the
                information that they might have missed out on in the first two
                rounds. Finally, they will reflect on their listening skills.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <li>
            Listening helps in comprehending audio/video scripts, reading aloud
            texts, and answering comprehension and inferential questions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Listens to announcements and instructions; reads aloud texts, audio,
            and videos for information, gist, and details; responds by answering
            questions accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            By listening, students will understand the different uses of
            appropriate words through a variety of listening and speaking
            activities on topics such as sports, cookery, music, gardening, and
            riding. Use these registers in their day-to-day lives and use them
            wherever necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acquire the ability to listen and understand, and you should be able
            to employ non-verbal clues to make connections and draw inferences.
          </li>
        </ul>
